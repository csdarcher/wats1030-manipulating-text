I am writing this file using Emacs so I think that means it won. I found it fairly easy to navigate. However, I did find it cumbersome to exit out of a file just to open another file to work on. I would prefer to have the option to save what I am working on, then open a new file and start working on that. Maybe there is a way to do this, but I was not able to figure it out. I also never really got a handle on the Emacs search and replace feature. This process seemed easier when I was in Nano and Vi. Nano was a close second for me, but I hated how it didn't break up the lines. You either have to be very good with the "go to end of line" command and/or have the patience to just keep scrolling. Vi wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be, but I did find it annoying to have to make sure I was in the correct mode at all times. Overall I think I want to keep learning and trying out all three text editors. Right now Emacs is my preferred, but who knows, that may change as I get to know more about them.
