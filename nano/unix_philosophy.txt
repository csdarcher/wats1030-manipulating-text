The Unix Philosophy
From the UNIX Programming Environment (1984) by Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike

Even though the UNIX system introduces a number of innnovative programs and techniques, no single program or idea makes it work well. Instead, what makes it effective is the approach to prgramming, a philosophy of using the computer. Although that philosophy can't be written down in a single sentence, at its heart is the idea that the power of a system comes more from the relationships among programs than from the programs t\hemselves. Many UNIZ programs do quite trivial things in isolation, but, combined with other programs, become general and useful tools.
